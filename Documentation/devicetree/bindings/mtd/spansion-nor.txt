* Spansion NOR flash

Optional properties:
- spansion,latency-code : Only used when the "m25p,num-dummy-cycles" property is
                          set. The Spansion latency code tells the NOR flash
                          memory the number of dummy cycles to expect for each
                          Fast Read command. The value to be used is provided by
                          tables in the memory datasheet and depends on the SPI
                          clock frequency and on the Single/Dual Data Rate mode.
                          Then the value of "m25p,num-dummy-cycles" property
                          should match the (Fast) Read command to be used for
                          the chosen latency code.

Example:

	m25p80@0 {
		compatible = "spansion,s25fl512s";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <104000000>;
		m25p,num-dummy-cycles = <8>;
		spansion,latency-code = <2>;
	};
